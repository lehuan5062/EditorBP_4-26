Update batch rename and material instance creation from [EditorBP_4-24](https://github.com/lehuan5062/EditorBP_4-24) to better methods:
- Both now use right click like in [EditorBP_4-27](https://github.com/lehuan5062/EditorBP_4-27).
- Material instance creation sample now prompt an UI to select parent material and path. Automatically assign texture.

Require 4.26.2 or higher.
